domains: detection engineering, incident response, digital forensics, threathunting, vulnerability management, corporate security, security risk analysis,security operations, security automation, security analytics, AI security, andsecurity engineering.
- I have experience both working in a large organization (>10k employees),implementing with security at scale, as well as smaller/startup environment (2k+employees) where the team is more lean/broad-scoped, allowing me to wearmany hats.
- I am currently working full-time as a Senior Security Engineer in the DefenseEngineering and Threat Hunting (DETH) team at Gusto, primarily leading/buildingdetection engineering and vuln management functions, but also building threathunting and sec ops with a focus on scaling and automating.
- Previously a member of Paranoids TSR/FIRE team at Yahoo/Verizon Media/Oath,focusing on incident response and automations.
- M.S. Security Informatics from Johns Hopkins University and GIAC CertifiedIncident Handler.
- I am passionate about always learning and applying my knowledge and skills ininformation security, specifically in the areas of security engineering, threatdetection, vulnerability management, and security analytics. I also have a fairamount of knowledge in applied cryptography, web security, and softwaresecurity.
- I feel strongly that security should be something that engineering/productteams have ownership of, and the security team's job should be topartner/assist/collaborate with/empower their efforts in writing secure code andbuilding things safely. Partnerships between IT/eng teams and security are superimportant.
P.S. I'm not interested in: contract roles, roles in toxic companies (badly handledlayoffs/RTOs, removing DEI policies, etc.), or roles that require relocating to adifferent country/state. I also don't accept random LinkedIn connection requestsunless I've met and interacted with you either in-person or through a video call.Thank you.

Ricky is without a doubt one of the best managers I've ever worked with,and I will always appreciate my time working with him, both as his directreport at one point, and later as a fellow coworker.
