Security Informatics from Johns Hopkins University and GIAC CertifiedIncident Handler. - I am passionate about always learning and applying my knowledge and skills ininformation security, specifically in the areas of security engineering, threatdetection, vulnerability management, and security analytics. I also have a fairamount of knowledge in applied cryptography, web security, and softwaresecurity. - I feel strongly that security should be something that engineering/productteams have ownership of, and the security team's job should be topartner/assist/collaborate with/empower their efforts in writing secure code andbuilding things safely. Partnerships between IT/eng teams and security are superimportant. P.S. I'm not interested in: contract roles, roles in toxic companies (badly handledlayoffs/RTOs, removing DEI policies, etc.), or roles that require relocating to adifferent country/state. I also don't accept random LinkedIn connection requestsunless I've met and interacted with you either in-person or through a video call.Thank you.
